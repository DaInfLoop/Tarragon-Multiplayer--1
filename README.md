# Tarragon

The ice kingdom has captured you and destroyed the realm of dragons.  You and the last remaining dragon team up together to try and unite other elemental kingdoms to help you to detroy the ice realm.

Use your platforming skills and the firey (and spicy!) breath of the dragon to defeat your foes and accomplish your goal.

Enjoy four boss fights, fourteen levels, and loads of unexpected fun.

Plot twist: You need to collect a variety of chili peppers for the dragon or he **won't be able to breathe fire**!!
